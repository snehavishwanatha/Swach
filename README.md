# Swach
#### Created at PES hackathon 2019

## *Objective:* 
An app which focuses on a better waste management system which is user friendly and also paves a path in keeping the society clean and beautiful.
How many situations has one come across where he/she wanted to dispose the waste but couldn't find a garbage can near by ? Wouldn't it be great if he/she could find one at that moment!!

Wouldn't it be favourable if there was a better communication channel between the public and waste management department? A way towards a collaborative step towards cleaner and healthy society.

The app is beneficial for both citizens and Waste Management Departments in the city.

### Features for Citizens

• Our app shows the locations of all the garbage cans near the user's current location, so that he/she can efficiently dispose the waste instead of littering around.

• When someone notices the garbage can is overfilled or improperly maintained, he/she can notify the management authorities about it.

• They can also issue complaints and provide opinions for a cleaner locality.

• Any shopkeeper can contirbute to this initiative by keeping a garbage bin near their shop and providing its location in the app for public's use.

### Features for Waste Management Departments

Departments and stakeholders are responsible for providing the garbage cans/bins in all localities and uploading the locations with thier unique ID on the app.

• Departments are notified by the app about the conditions of the bins in various locations of the city by the people. So that they can efficiently maintain the wastes and bins.

• By providing a forum, the app acts as a bridge between the people and the management so that they can collaboratively keep the society clean.

• Departments can hosts awareness programs and initiative on the app which can be notified to the public so that they can provide funds and contribute towards it

An idea towards #swachbharat and a healthier society.
